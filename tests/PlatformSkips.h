// Why a case cannot observe what it is about, on this platform, as a sentence.
//
// Several cases in this suite need a path the current user is not allowed to read or
// write, and set that up with std::filesystem::permissions. There are two ways a
// platform cannot produce one:
//
//   root ignores the permission bits, so a mode-000 file is still readable
//   Windows has no POSIX mode bits at all for permissions() to clear
//
// Either way the case cannot fail, and a case that cannot fail is the shape AGENTS.md
// records five earlier instances of - a check that passed while blind. So it says
// which of the two it hit and skips, rather than passing without having observed
// anything. Written once here so that no case can quietly ask a weaker question than
// its neighbours, and so that adding the Windows arm was one edit rather than four.
